            <p>Im a future front-end developer with a dancers background. <br/>I know my hunger for creativity will be an asset in this new direction. And thru the years IÂ´ve inspired kids and youth when working as a "dance teacher". < br/> Inspiration is what lits creative minds, finding new ways to solve the future obstacles we face. <br/> With my finnish mentality, Im honest, I work hard and the inner SISU = I never give up, look to it that I get things done. ... But Ive learned thru the years to ask for help if needed. </p>
